# Quo vadis? -- reflecting my first career decade

This year is gonna be my first decade being a programmer, in a way I prefer to call myself a software engineer.

I know nothing about programming before I went to university. Like many other high school students in China, after I went through the [Gaokao, i.e. The National College Entrance Examination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaokao), I had to pick a major at the university. My score wasn't great and I couldn't get into the schools that I like. I was quite disappointed and depressed. So I picked the major randomly (quite irresponsible for myself, to be hoest). It was Networking Engineering.

## An accidental start

However, I was lucky enough to have joined a lab working on real-life software projects. The lab was started by an awesome teacher and a few really talented students. It was called Wando, which kinda means "wanna do"

## Lower level stuff



## Lost in progression

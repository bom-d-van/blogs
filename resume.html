    <p>I have almost 10 years of experiences being a software engineer,
    covering from front end all the way to the back end systems and are
    familiar with scaling and developing highly concurrent, highly
    available distributed systems.</p>
    <p>My current focus is in highly available infrastructure services,
    distributed systems, database kernel development (both TSDB and
    general), and system programming.</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Programming languages: Go, C, C++, Bash, Perl, Java, JS, Ruby,
    Python, Rust.</li>

    <p>Achievements:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Scaling large scale distributed time series systems (Graphite)
    <ul>
    <li>Scale: over 1k servers, over 1 PB SSD storage, 500 million uniq metrics, 2k QPS, 30m data points per second on ingestion.</li>
    <li>By adopting <a href="https://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol8/p1816-teller.pdf">Facebook Gorilla compression algorithm</a>, design and implement a new file format for compression that reduces disk space usage from 30% - 70%.</li>
    <li>Design and implementing a new index algorithm by using <a href="https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/regexp1.html">NFA+DFA algorithms introduced by Russ Cox</a> that is able to support 10 - 40 millions uniq metric paths with low indexing overhead and low tail latencies.</li>
    <li>Introducing a quota subsystem for reliability and control that are able efficiently</li>
    <li>Design and implement a <a href="https://www.xhu.buzz/ctrie/ctrie.html">lockless and concurrent trie indexing</a> that were able to reduce memory usage and supports real time indexing</li>
    <li>Design and implement a higher performant <a href="https://github.com/go-graphite/go-carbon/pull/420">Quota subsystems</a> that able to reduce the noisy neighbor effect in a multi-tenant environment and achieves efficient resource management and control</li>
    <li>Optimize the rebalance tool for the systems, by introducing <a href="https://github.com/go-graphite/buckytools/pull/26">a self-regulated mechanism using health check and jitters</a>, the changes has produced faster and adjustable sync rate and enhances observability.</li>
    </ul></li>
